# PARM-code-assembler
a Java program that transforms assemble code into hexa machine instruction. Used for a school project.

## About
The goal of this application is to convert ARM-cortex-V0 compatible assembly code in hexadecimal code ready to be executed by an ARM-cortex-V0 CPU.
Keep in mind that this is only a quick school project.
  
However, if you're interested in it, you can still clone the repo and have fun with editing the code.

## Download :
You can download the .jar executable file [here](https://github.com/Natsukooh/PARM-code-assembler/releases/download/v1.0/PARM-code-assembler-1.0.jar).

## Usage :
`java -jar PARM-code-assembler-1.0 <path to assembly file> <path to output file>`

`<assembly file>` is the file to convert, and `<output file>` is the output for the hexadecimal code. If the output file is not provided, the result will be printed in console.
